# Human-action-recognition

The main objective of this project is to create a system for recognizing human actions using inertial sensors. These sensors, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, are integrated into a smartphone to collect real-time inertial signals. The action recognition system will use these signals to identify the action being performed.
